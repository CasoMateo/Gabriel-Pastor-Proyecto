**Version 1.0.0**

An effective system to evaluate and control nursing home inventories that uses several statistics to optimize resources.

Users are granted the opportunity to add and update medicines based on real-world usage, with an intuitive infrastructure based on medicine expiry dates.
Medicines are registered in <b> MongoDB </b>, which connects to the <b> React </b> frontend through a <b> FastAPI </b>-based backend. Additional, such as <b> Chartjs </b>, are used 
to display visual statistics about the promixity of future medicines' expiry, thus facilitating **inventory management** in a dynamic way. 

The list of available **medicines** is displayed as follows:

with options of addition and consumption (arrival of new packages or usage of past ones) and the capacity to

with the dates of each package being featured in the upper part of the screen, and a flexible illustration of
